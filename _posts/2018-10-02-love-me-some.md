✓ Power at 240V/60A breaker box 
✓ 240V to the line in at the disconnect box
✓ 240V to the line out at the disconnect box
𐄂 240V at the wall charger

Disconnect the wall charger.

✓ 240V to the lines at the wall charger

🤔

Electrician didn't clamp the wires down properly within the wall charger, so as soon as some current came through the lines, they moved breaking their connection to the box. Awesome.

Wall charger is working now, email to the electrician time!

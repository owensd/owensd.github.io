This is beyond ridiculous and just terrible customer service.

Just a brief summary for the fun experience I've had trying to order a desk from IKEA (I've ordered before with no issues...):

  * Ordered a desk on 8/2.
  * Original delivery scheduled for 8/11
  * Attempt to call multiple times to re-schedule for 8/18
  * Shipping calls for delivery, finally updated to 8/18
  * Call for window between 1-4 on 8/18
  * No delivery
  * Call shipping company (multiple times throughout the week), they don't know where the package is and they have no response from their "dock search", even with "management involved" (this is T-Force)
  * Multiple calls to IKEA, which has the worst phone system ever... either busy, or you get through to a few menus deep and are told about "Unexpected high call volume" and hung-up on. I've called multiple times throughout multiple weeks... this doesn't seem like "unexpected high call volume"; seems normal.
  * **Finally** get to talk to an IKEA customer service rep after 45 minutes on hold. Says, "oh, this is easy to fix"... moments later, he transfers me to the shipping company, that is closed. ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬
  * FIll out online form to cancel order, no response after 4 days.
  
So, my options seem to be:
  
  * Continue to wait, irrationally, for my package to be found
  * Continue to waste time on trying to actually get in contact with someone at IKEA's customer service department
  * Go into IKEA the when I'm up in the office for work, wasting more time to try and get this resolved - of course, since it's an online order, they are probably going to be unlikely to have the ability to help me
  * Dispute the charge with the credit card company
  
All I wanted was a desk for my wife's computer... ðŸ˜­

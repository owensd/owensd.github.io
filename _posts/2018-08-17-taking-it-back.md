Today I've started the long process of transitioning all of my online profiles over to places where I have the control of my data and who sees it. I already had a semi-personal, semi-self-work-related location with owensd.io.

But it's time. Even as much as I trust Apple with my data, there's no real reason why they should be in charge of my email and data. As for Google... well, I'm far overdue at finally ditching their email services.

Welcome @slofamily.com. Both Twitter and Facebook will be tough to move from, but, even if I can just use those services and *linking places* for family and friends to find my content, that's a huge improvement.

It's not much, but it's a start at starting the process of getting back control.

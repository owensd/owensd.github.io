I have a bunch of stuff to cleanup my social profile that I've been meaning to do for a long time, including:

1. Finally getting rid of my google account. It's just time to do it.
2. Delete my Twitter history, if not just deactivate the account there all together.
3. Sort out a proper VPN to use and get that setup. I started with Eero Plus, but that seems like a huge waste of money (and yes, I know it's not a VPN, but I was looking for content filtering for the kids).

I'm happy to pay for a service is that keeps the barrier for entry just that much higher, plus, maybe this will encourage more thoughtful posts.

Only time will tell.

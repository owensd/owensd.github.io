This time, it's with Microsoft. As some of my previous *thoughts* (that's what I'm calling micro.blog posts üòè) talked about: I upgraded my daughter's computer due to some case re-arrangments. In th process, I also upgraded my computer to a Ryzen 5 2600X and a new motherboard.

Of course, Windows was not happy. I couldn't get the activation to work, even though I have a valid Win 10 Pro key purchased from the Microsoft Alumni web store. 

So... I called customer support thinking, na√Øvely it turns out, that it would be much better than my [IKEA ordeal](http://thoughts.owensd.io/2018/08/25/why-is-this.html) (oh, and apparently is magically resolved today - we'll see). 

The first rep, which I got in contact with in only a few moments (looking good so far!). Well, this person tried to help me, but since I was getting the dreaded **0xC004E003**, they couldn't help me and needed to transfer me to the store.

OK, no worries... except they transferred me to a brick-n-mortar Microsoft store. Ugh? This lady was all confused and obviously couldn't help me with my problem.

So I call back, run through all of the same steps, and the tech couldn't help me. Says he will transfer me to another tech. 

...

...

...

Like 30 minutes later on hold, still crickets.

At this point, it's just better for my health at this point to pay the $40 to buy a new license, as stupid as that is. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

May your customer service adventures be more pleasant then mine have been lately.

After much deliberation on a commute vehicle replacement for the motorcycle (lots of reasons there...), the Tesla M3 came out as the winner as not only the most cost effective means of travel, but the most fun to drive.

I placed an order on Thursday. Delivery slated for Monday! Now... to figure out how to get to work on Monday... I think a rental car is the best option. ðŸ¤” Heh, or I could tow it back with my Jeep. ðŸ¤£

Hmm... I also need to get a wall charger installed at home pronto!

It’s just time to do it.</li>\n  <li>Delete my Twitter history, if not just deactivate the account there all together.</li>\n  <li>Sort out a proper VPN to use and get that setup. I started with Eero Plus, but that seems like a huge waste of money (and yes, I know it’s not a VPN, but I was looking for content filtering for the kids).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I’m happy to pay for a service is that keeps the barrier for entry just that much higher, plus, maybe this will encourage more thoughtful posts.</p>\n\n<p>Only time will tell.</p>\n",

Delivery slated for Monday! Now… to figure out how to get to work on Monday… I think a rental car is the best option. 🤔 Heh, or I could two back with my Jeep. 🤣</p>\n\n<p>Hmm… I also need to get a wall charger installed at home pronto!</p>\n",

As some of my previous <em>thoughts</em> (that’s what I’m calling micro.blog posts 😏) talked about: I upgraded my daughter’s computer due to some case re-arrangments. In th process, I also upgraded my computer to a Ryzen 5 2600X and a new motherboard.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, Windows was not happy. I couldn’t get the activation to work, even though I have a valid Win 10 Pro key purchased from the Microsoft Alumni web store.</p>\n\n<p>So… I called customer support thinking, naïvely it turns out, that it would be much better than my <a href=\"http://thoughts.owensd.io/2018/08/25/why-is-this.html\">IKEA ordeal</a> (oh, and apparently is magically resolved today - we’ll see).</p>\n\n<p>The first rep, which I got in contact with in only a few moments (looking good so far!). Well, this person tried to help me, but since I was getting the dreaded <strong>0xC004E003</strong>, they couldn’t help me and needed to transfer me to the store.</p>\n\n<p>OK, no worries… except they transferred me to a brick-n-mortar Microsoft store. Ugh? This lady was all confused and obviously couldn’t help me with my problem.</p>\n\n<p>So I call back, run through all of the same steps, and the tech couldn’t help me. Says he will transfer me to another tech.</p>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<p>Like 30 minutes later on hold, still crickets.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>At this point, it’s just better for my health at this point to pay the $40 to buy a new license, as stupid as that is. 🤦🏻‍♂️</p>\n\n<p>May your customer service adventures be more pleasant then mine have been lately.</p>\n",

I’ve called multiple times throughout multiple weeks… this doesn’t seem like “unexpected high call volume”; seems normal.</li>\n  <li><strong>Finally</strong> get to talk to an IKEA customer service rep after 45 minutes on hold.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The worst thing about my Model 3 so far: I really want an X now too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The experiment of stopping at the supercharger near work - not so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel took a lot longer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coffee more expensive, better though&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charging rate half the speed as the chargers are nearly full&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to know, though it may be worth trying once more with a different route.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Supercharging is so fast!! A quick 15 minute stop charges nearly the same amount as an all day charge at work, and costs less!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Love me some 240V/60A electrical work...</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;‚úì Power at 240V/60A breaker box 
‚úì 240V to the line in at the disconnect box
‚úì 240V to the line out at the disconnect box
êÑÇ 240V at the wall charger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disconnect the wall charger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚úì 240V to the lines at the wall charger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ü§î&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrician didn‚Äôt clamp the wires down properly within the wall charger, so as soon as some current came through the lines, they moved breaking their connection to the box. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall charger is working now, email to the electrician time!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Joy‚Ä¶ after an all day install for my wall charger, I go to plug it in (the charger had the green light), and nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall charger die? So unbelievably frustrated right now. Such a waste of time today.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about at Tesla DIY project is the ridiculous home charging solutions that people are using to plug into their cars‚Ä¶ like really? You drop, in some cases, over $100,000 and use setups that clearly violate the NEC to charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umm‚Ä¶ ok.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well‚Ä¶ I started with an estimated 260 mile range home. Traveled 197.5 miles with an estimated 25 mile range remaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average of 283 Wh/mi used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too bad, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The test: can I make it home when my car says I have a 260 range???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The go-no-go is about 70 miles south. After that point, no charger for another 110 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;First real commute in with the Model 3. First thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;effective range is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; lower when going 70+ mph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first 2/3rds is so much nicer than both the Jeep and bike&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;last 1/3rd much less stressful with auto-pilot (stop-n-go traffic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a very big upgrade!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Commute Vehicle</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After much deliberation on a commute vehicle replacement for the motorcycle (lots of reasons there‚Ä¶), the Tesla M3 came out as the winner as not only the most cost effective means of travel, but the most fun to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I placed an order on Thursday. Delivery slated for Monday! Now‚Ä¶ to figure out how to get to work on Monday‚Ä¶ I think a rental car is the best option. ü§î Heh, or I could tow it back with my Jeep. ü§£&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm‚Ä¶ I also need to get a wall charger installed at home pronto!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;At 17mpg, my Jeep makes a terrible commuter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best options I‚Äôm looking at are the ‚Äò15 BMW 328d and ‚Äò15 Audi 3 TDI, both about 45 mpg. Even factoring in vehicle cost, I‚Äôm looking at a savings of $2500+ per year. A Model 3 is only an effective saving of $1300 (new car $$$).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I sometimes get far too angry about programming annoyances. Latest example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;private var session: URLSession? = nil
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, but no‚Ä¶ I need to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;private var session: URLSession?

public init(session: URLSession? = nil) {
    self.session = session

        <title>More Customer Service Fun</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This time, it‚Äôs with Microsoft. As some of my previous &lt;em&gt;thoughts&lt;/em&gt; (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm calling micro.blog posts üòè) talked about: I upgraded my daughter‚Äôs computer due to some case re-arrangments. In th process, I also upgraded my computer to a Ryzen 5 2600X and a new motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Windows was not happy. I couldn‚Äôt get the activation to work, even though I have a valid Win 10 Pro key purchased from the Microsoft Alumni web store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So‚Ä¶ I called customer support thinking, na√Øvely it turns out, that it would be much better than my &lt;a href=&quot;http://thoughts.owensd.io/2018/08/25/why-is-this.html&quot;&gt;IKEA ordeal&lt;/a&gt; (oh, and apparently is magically resolved today - we‚Äôll see).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first rep, which I got in contact with in only a few moments (looking good so far!). Well, this person tried to help me, but since I was getting the dreaded &lt;strong&gt;0xC004E003&lt;/strong&gt;, they couldn‚Äôt help me and needed to transfer me to the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, no worries‚Ä¶ except they transferred me to a brick-n-mortar Microsoft store. Ugh? This lady was all confused and obviously couldn‚Äôt help me with my problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I call back, run through all of the same steps, and the tech couldn‚Äôt help me. Says he will transfer me to another tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like 30 minutes later on hold, still crickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it‚Äôs just better for my health at this point to pay the $40 to buy a new license, as stupid as that is. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May your customer service adventures be more pleasant then mine have been lately.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Of course all of IKEA‚Äôs customer support ‚Äúcircuits are busy‚Äù‚Ä¶ the pain keeps coming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why is this so hard!?</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is beyond ridiculous and just terrible customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a brief summary for the fun experience I‚Äôve had trying to order a desk from IKEA (I‚Äôve ordered before with no issues‚Ä¶):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ordered a desk on 8/2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Original delivery scheduled for 8/11&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attempt to call multiple times to re-schedule for 8/18&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shipping calls for delivery, finally updated to 8/18&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Call for window between 1-4 on 8/18&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No delivery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Call shipping company (multiple times throughout the week), they don‚Äôt know where the package is and they have no response from their ‚Äúdock search‚Äù, even with ‚Äúmanagement involved‚Äù (this is T-Force)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple calls to IKEA, which has the worst phone system ever‚Ä¶ either busy, or you get through to a few menus deep and are told about ‚ÄúUnexpected high call volume‚Äù and hung-up on. I‚Äôve called multiple times throughout multiple weeks‚Ä¶ this doesn‚Äôt seem like ‚Äúunexpected high call volume‚Äù; seems normal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally&lt;/strong&gt; get to talk to an IKEA customer service rep after 45 minutes on hold. Says, ‚Äúoh, this is easy to fix‚Äù‚Ä¶ moments later, he transfers me to the shipping company, that is closed. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FIll out online form to cancel order, no response after 4 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my options seem to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue to wait, irrationally, for my package to be found&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue to waste time on trying to actually get in contact with someone at IKEA‚Äôs customer service department&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go into IKEA the when I‚Äôm up in the office for work, wasting more time to try and get this resolved - of course, since it‚Äôs an online order, they are probably going to be unlikely to have the ability to help me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dispute the charge with the credit card company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I wanted was a desk for my wife‚Äôs computer‚Ä¶ üò≠&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate graphs like this; they provide no actual information and are clearly meant to tell a story that the author wants you to see instead of providing actual information that you can understands based on facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole RTX launch seems super sketchy to me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After switching cases with my daughter, I got downgraded to a Ryzen 2200. I tried to suffer with huge mid-tower and ATX motherboard and only get a 2600x and 1060 replacement card for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a new case, ITX MB, and Noctua cooling setup coming this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The RTX 20* series looks pretty interesting, but my guess is they offer little, if any, gain over the current GTX 10* series in terms of FPS for games not specifically built for the architecture, and even then, it looks like it‚Äôs going to be a quality boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need some reviews!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I swapped my CPU and graphics card out with my daughter‚Äôs PC so she could have a smaller case to fit on her small desk. &lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt; now my computer won‚Äôt really work because the video card cooler fan (hijacked from an eGPU enclosure) hits the CMOS battery. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been looking at a photo editing computer for my wife the past few weeks. I went back and forth all over the spectrum (iMac, MBP, PC, Hackintosh). Decided on the 15‚Äù MacBook Pro as it allows us to progressively dive deeper with an external display and an eGPU.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;IKEA desk comes tomorrow. Still debating on a 13‚Äù MacBook Pro + external display or just canabilizing my gaming PC for my wife‚Äôs new photo editing/managing station. And potentially switching it over to an Intel platform. ü§î&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Projects: Back to C</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really enjoy doing in my space time is playing D&amp;amp;D. Now, I don‚Äôt get a lot of time to do it, and when I do get to, I mostly play online. I‚Äôve tried pretty much all of the tools out there from &lt;a href=&quot;http://roll20.net&quot;&gt;Roll 20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fantasygrounds.com&quot;&gt;Fantasy Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dndbeyond.com&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;D Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, Discord, and combinations of all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem: none of them actually solve my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to my current hobby project: an online game management tool. Now, the fundamental problem with Roll 20 and Fantasy Grounds is that they are relatively closed eco-systems; you really need to buy into (quite literally!) in order to make the most of it. Now, Fantasy Grounds is far more flexible and you can basically encode anything you want, it‚Äôs a lot of time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that‚Äôs where my project comes into play. I really like the premise around &lt;a href=&quot;http://dndbeyond.com&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;D Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, however, it‚Äôs also a fairly closed ecosystem providing no APIs to interact with it. However, since D&amp;amp;D Beyond is mainly a D&amp;amp;D Book archive, I can work with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now‚Ä¶ the goals of the project are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a system that works on macOS, iOS, and Windows. My players use varied systems and I need to support all three of those.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create an open ecosystem where there is a fluid flow of information coming into the app and going out of the app. If you love Ulysses or Scrivener for writing your campaigns, use it! The app is to help you run your table top session, not management everything else for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High performance, low battery impact. A D&amp;amp;D session can be 3~5 hours long and I don‚Äôt want people reaching for their chargers part way in or losing access to their character if they are on their laptop or iOS device, especially if we are at the table.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A learning project for certain things that I just don‚Äôt know too much about, such as low-level graphics frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The foundation for other projects that I have that I‚Äôd like to work on‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;secret projects&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key features, if not the primary feature, is an interactive mapping environment. This is going to likely be a top-down view of a true 3D environment with dynamic lighting, character line-of-sight handling, and turn management tools (including things like measuring movement distances and area of effect areas templates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to technology and language choices. Now, remember, this is going to be a truly cross-platform app. It also has the need of being run offline or over local-networks only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic choices are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;web-technology based, such as Electron or Atom&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;game engine based, such as Unreal or Unit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using some type of cross-platform application layer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;handmade, native app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For various reasons that I don‚Äôt really want to fully go into here, an Electron-based app is out. High performance, low battery life, small footprint, full offline, and cross-platform make a solution like this challenging, especially for a 3D engine. Sure, WebGL is pretty good, and there is WASM, but ultimately, this is really an unproven technology for this type of application. Also, I‚Äôd need a different solution on mobile vs. desktop, which starts to complicate the picture as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok‚Ä¶ so Unreal or Unity based? I haven‚Äôt fully rejected this idea, but it would likely only be for the map rendering portion as the vast majority of the rest my content is going to be primary text-based UIs (character sheets, rule references, story content, etc‚Ä¶). Unity‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve played around with it in the past and it just didn‚Äôt stick with me, so I‚Äôd use Unreal if I went this route. The question always is does this dependency warrant the design decisions and complexity? I‚Äôm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-platform layer‚Ä¶ no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A native app. Now, this brings the downside of having to re-build the UI layer for each support platform, and for a hobby and one-man-team, that kinda stinks. BUT! I think it‚Äôs totally worth it. This choice also brings with it full control over all aspects of the project and how it is shaped. There‚Äôs a lot to be said about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language choices: really, there is only really one option that brings straight-forward interop between the various languages choices that may come up: C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust requires bindings and unsafe code; this ends up being a good amount of work to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++ is C++. It‚Äôs a very complex and large language. Interop with other languages can be problematic as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swift, well, it‚Äôs simply not cross-platform and isn‚Äôt going to meet my needs for a Windows install. So it‚Äôs out by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C is the only language that brings to the table straight-forward interop with all of the platform UI languages (I‚Äôll likely use C# for Windows and ObjC or Swift for macOS and iOS). If I use Swift and I chose C++, I‚Äôd have to write a long of interop bindings between the two and that is just a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôll be using C and the internet can collectively gasp at my choice. üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Taking it Back, One Step at a Time</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I‚Äôve started the long process of transitioning all of my online profiles over to places where I have the control of my data and who sees it. I already had a semi-personal, semi-self-work-related location with owensd.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it‚Äôs time. Even as much as I trust Apple with my data, there‚Äôs no real reason why they should be in charge of my email and data. As for Google‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôm far overdue at finally ditching their email services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome @slofamily.com. Both Twitter and Facebook will be tough to move from, but, even if I can just use those services and &lt;em&gt;linking places&lt;/em&gt; for family and friends to find my content, that‚Äôs a huge improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs a start at starting the process of getting back control.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I like most about micro.blog is having the ability to easily separate out the idle chat and information from my &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; blog content (yeah yeah‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt published there in a while!).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Cleaning</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of stuff to cleanup my social profile that I‚Äôve been meaning to do for a long time, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally getting rid of my google account. It‚Äôs just time to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delete my Twitter history, if not just deactivate the account there all together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out my Facebook transition‚Ä¶ this is tough as it‚Äôs the only real family connection service‚Ä¶ gotta think about this one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sort out a proper VPN to use and get that setup. I started with Eero Plus, but that seems like a huge waste of money (and yes, I know it‚Äôs not a VPN, but I was looking for content filtering for the kids).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm happy to pay for a service is that keeps the barrier for entry just that much higher, plus, maybe this will encourage more thoughtful posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
